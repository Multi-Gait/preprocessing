* For a quick start, we have provided the npy dataset exported by the [mat2npy.py](https://github.com/Multi-Gait/preprocessing/blob/d6258e5dc3fa3f39d40dec6eb8b259ab82d1619e/Scripts/Mat2Npy/mat2npy.py) script.
  
* The npy dataset can be downloaded from xxx.

* We expect developers to design various algorithms to evaluate the quality of our dataset.
