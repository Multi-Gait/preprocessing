* For a quick start, we have provided the npy dataset exported by the [[mat2npy.py](Scripts/Mat2Npy/mat2npy.py)](https://github.com/Multi-Gait/preprocessing/blob/7e920f5a5e63fbbd7a6dd15a853f9e822b9f354e/Scripts/Mat2Npy/mat2npy.py) script.

* The npy dataset can be downloaded from xxx.

* We expect developers to design various algorithms to evaluate the quality of our dataset.
